Brat2Viz is a narrative annotation visualization tool developed by the [Text2Story Research Group](https://text2story.inesctec.pt). In developing this tool my main contribution relay in the parsing of annotated input data
into a formal representation (DRS -- Discourse Representation Structure), i.e., in the so called Brat2DRS module.
