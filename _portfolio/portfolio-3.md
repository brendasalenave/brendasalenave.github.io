This repository brings together the main codes developed for the conclusion work of the Data Science and Machine Learning course at TERA and was jointly prepared by Brenda Salenave Santana, Christianne Dalforno, Daniel Jullien, João Pedro Rodrigues Oliveira, Livia dos Santos Pereira.

Project Goal: Provide the user with reading recommendations according to their preference at the moment through a recommendation system capable of suggesting, based on some parameters informed by the user at the time of the recommendation (e.g., previously read books similar to what is intended), which books could be chosen as your next read.
