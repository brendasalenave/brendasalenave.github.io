excerpt: 'Bayesian Classifiers are classifiers that use statistics to classify an attribute to a given class based on the probability of this object belonging to thisclass. In this paper, the use of machine learning techniques, aiming at external relations between the entities named in the same literary work. From theseclassifiers, applied in a test model were able to arrive at a result capable of indicating the potentiality of use of Bayesian classifiers as tools of summarization of texts.'
