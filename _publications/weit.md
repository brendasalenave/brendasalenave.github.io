title: " Máquina de Turing Reversível: Um Estudo de Caso"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/weit
excerpt: 'This paper presents the concept of a Reversible Turing Machine and a case study based on the model idealized by Charles Bennett in 1973. In order to exemplify such a theoretical computation model, a machine was elaborated according to the presented guidelines in the article “Logical Reversibility of Computation”. For this purpose the Java programming language was used. The machine presented in this article receives an input from a standard Turing
Machine, and converts the transition functions so that they are reversible, so that any action taken can be undone.'
