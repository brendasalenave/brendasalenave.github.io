title: "Brat2Viz: a Tool and Pipeline for Visualizing Narratives from Annotated Texts"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/brat2viz
excerpt: 'Narrative Extraction from text is a complex task that starts by identifying a set of narrative elements (actors, events, times), and the semantic
links between them (temporal, referential, semantic roles). The outcome is a structure or set of structures which can then be represented
graphically, thus opening room for further and alternative exploration
of the plot. Such visualization can also be useful during the on-going
annotation process. Manual annotation of narratives can be a complex
effort and the possibility offered by the Brat annotation tool of annotating directly on the text does not seem suciently helpful. In this
paper, we propose Brat2Viz, a tool and a pipeline that displays visualization of narrative information annotated in Brat. Brat2Viz reads the
annotation file of Brat, produces an intermediate representation in the
declarative language DRS (Discourse Representation Structure), and from this obtains the visualization. Currently, we make available two visualization schemes: MSC (Message Sequence Chart) and Knowledge
Graphs. The modularity of the pipeline enables the future extension
to new annotation sources, different annotation schemes, and alternative visualizations or representations. We illustrate the pipeline using examples from an European Portuguese news corpus.'
