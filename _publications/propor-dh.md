permalink: /publication/propor-dh
excerpt: '2018’s Brazilian presidential elections highlighted the influence of alternative media and social networks, such as Twitter. In this work, we perform an analysis covering politically motivated discourses related to the second round in Brazilian elections. In order to verify whether similar discourses reinforce group engagement to personal beliefs, we collected a set of tweets related to political hashtags at that moment. To this end, we have used a combination of topic modeling approach with opinion mining techniques to analyze the motivated political discourses. Using SentiLex-PT, a Portuguese sentiment lexicon,
we extracted from the dataset the top 5 most frequent group of words related to opinions. Applying a bag-of-words model, the cosine similarity calculation was performed between each opinion and the observed
groups. This study allowed us to observe an exacerbated use of passionate discourses in the digital political scenario as a form of appreciation and engagement to the groups which convey similar beliefs.'
