title: "TLS-Covid19: A New Annotated Corpus for Timeline Summarization"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/tls-covid19
excerpt: 'The rise of social media and the explosion of digital news in the web sphere have created new challenges to extract knowledge and make sense of published information. Automated timeline generation appears in this context as a promising answer to help users dealing with this information overload problem. Formally, Timeline Summarization (TLS) can be defined as a subtask of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) conceived to highlight the most important information during the development of a story over time by summarizing long-lasting events in a timely ordered fashion. As opposed to traditional MDS, TLS has a limited number of publicly available datasets. In this paper, we propose TLS-Covid19 dataset, a novel corpus for the Portuguese and English languages. Our aim is to provide a new, larger and multi-lingual TLS annotated dataset that could foster timeline summarization evaluation research and, at the same time, enable the study of news coverage about the COVID-19 pandemic. TLS-Covid19 consists of 178 curated topics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, with associated news articles covering almost the entire year of 2020 and their respective reference timelines as gold-standard. As a final outcome, we conduct an experimental study on the proposed dataset over two extreme baseline methods. All the resources are publicly available at https://github.com/LIAAD/tls-covid19.'
