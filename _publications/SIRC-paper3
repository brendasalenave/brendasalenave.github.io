excerpt: 'Bayesian Classifiers are classifiers that use statistics to classify an at-tribute to a given class based on the probability of this object belonging to thisclass. In this paper, the use of machine learning techniques, aiming at exter-nal relations between the entities named in the same literary work. From theseclassifiers, applied in a test model were able to arrive at a result capable of in-dicating the potentiality of use of Bayesian classifiers as tools of summarizationof texts.'

Bayesian Classifiers are classifiers that use statistics to classify an at-tribute to a given class based on the probability of this object belonging to thisclass. In this paper, the use of machine learning techniques, aiming at exter-nal relations between the entities named in the same literary work.
