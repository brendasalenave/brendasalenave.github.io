excerpt: 'The fast growth and popularization of computer networks created bigand complex interconnected equipment groups. These groups are ilustrated bynetwork topologies. As a way to guarantee good instantiations of network topo-logies and to test new network technologies, network emulations, such offered byMininet platform, may be used. This paper presents JMP, a solution thats addsan abstraction layer to create Mininet topologies by using JSON, facilitating theMininet emulator use for the prototyping environment creation.'
