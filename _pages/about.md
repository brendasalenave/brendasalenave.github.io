I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science by the Postgraduate Program in Computing at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. I have a master's degree in the same area and institution (2019). My Bachelor's degree in Computer Science was from the Federal University of Santa Maria (2017). During my graduation, I received a scholarship from the Tutorial Education Program of the Computer Science Course at the Federal University of Santa Maria for 3 years. I worked on several projects related to Teaching, Research, and Extension activities.

My research areas are mainly focused on data mining, natural language processing, and analysis of hate speech on social networks, and also have experience in the areas of Conceptual Modeling and Data Science in general. Currently, I am also linked to the Institute of Systems and Computers Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC TEC), collaborating on projects for the application of natural language processing aimed mainly at extracting text narratives. In this collaboration, my main contributions are linked to the [Text2Story project](https://text2story.inesctec.pt).
