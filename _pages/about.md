I am a curious NLP researcher with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Postgraduate Program in Computing at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. Also, I have a master's degree in the same area and institution (2019). My Bachelor's degree in Computer Science was from the Federal University of Santa Maria (2017). During my graduation, I received a scholarship from the Tutorial Education Program of the Computer Science Course at the Federal University of Santa Maria for 3 years. I worked on several Teaching, Research, and Extension projects.

My research areas mainly focus on data mining, natural language processing, and analysis of hate speech on social networks. I also have experience in Conceptual Modeling and Data Science in general. I recently collaborated with the Institute of Systems and Computers Engineering, Technology, and Science (INESC TEC), where I collaborated on projects for applying natural language processing to extract text narratives. In this collaboration, my main contributions were linked to the [Text2Story project](https://text2story.inesctec.pt).

In my P.h.D Thesis, I worked on studying the use of linguistic indicators characteristic of hate speech associated with computational methods (such as the classification of texts by machine learning algorithms). It sought to evaluate the use of such indicators to enable the framing of content disseminated on social networks from the perspective of Frame Semantics, considering the instantiation of a frame of symbolic violence to propose a means of interposing intolerant speeches.
